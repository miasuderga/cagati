		<p><strong>Free Crochet Scarf Patterns Using Dk Weight Yarn</strong>. Most hat patterns that you come across in knitting are made with worsted or bulky weight yarns. In granny stitch double crochet clusters are separated by chain stitches and then subsequent rows of dc clusters are worked into the chain spaces. Another way to work with different yarn weights is to use a thinner yarn to embellish your finished project. Many of the scarves are crocheted in different blends of yarn but if you prefer cotton simply find a cotton yarn in the same yarn weight category as suggested for the pattern.</p>
